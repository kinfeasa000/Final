    <p> Those are some of my favorite things. Some other things people don't know about me is that I play guitar at my youth church.
      And that my family and I are from a country in East Africa called Eritrea. I also want to say it's been good and I really 
      enjoyed this class and I think I will be pursuing it in college.
