    <p> â€œThe Great Gatsby" is a classic novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and set in the 1920s. The story revolves around the 
      charismatic and mysterious Jay Gatsby and his pursuit of the American Dream. The novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young 
      man who moves to New York and becomes Gatsby's neighbor. The novel takes place in the affluent Long Island communities of West 
      Egg and East Egg, where the wealthy elite reside. Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire, throws extravagant parties at his mansion
      in West Egg, hoping to attract the attention of his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby and Daisy had been romantically 
      involved before Gatsby went off to war, but Daisy married Tom Buchanan, a wealthy man from East Egg, while Gatsby was away. 
      Nick becomes a bridge between Gatsby and Daisy, and as the story unfolds, it becomes evident that Gatsby's sole purpose in life
      is to win Daisy back. Gatsby's parties, extravagant wealth, and mysterious persona mask his deep longing for a past that can 
      never be fully recaptured. The novel delves into themes of love, idealism, the corrupting power of wealth, and the impossibility
      of reliving the past. Fitzgerald's prose explores the stark contrast between the glamorous facade of the roaring twenties and
      the emptiness and moral decay that lie beneath. As the story progresses, tensions rise, and secrets are revealed. Tragedy
      strikes when Gatsby is implicated in the accidental death of Myrtle Wilson, Tom Buchanan's mistress, and is later murdered
      by George Wilson, Myrtle's husband, who believes Gatsby to be responsible. "The Great Gatsby" offers a profound critique of 
      the American Dream and the illusion of happiness that wealth and materialism can bring. It is a tragic tale that depicts the
      loss of innocence and the fleeting nature of dreams in the face of an unattainable past.</p>
